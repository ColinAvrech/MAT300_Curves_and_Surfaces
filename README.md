MAT300_Curves_and_Surfaces
==========================
This is the project folder for my MAT300 course at digipen.

The course is called Curves and Surfaces and has to deal with the mathematics and implementation of mathematical algorithms 
based on DeCastleJau and DeBoor's Algorithms. These algorithms have applicative uses in computer science for graphics, audio and
AI pathfinding. External applications include other uses of curves such as car and airplane design among numerous others.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely, Colin Avrech.
